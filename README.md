# Shooting Game Test

## Introduction

This is my introductory commitment of Godot Project. I almost forget how to use git. So the process canbe like awkward. Please pardon me about this. I will elaborate to re-learn how to use this.

## The GOAL

+ Create Simple 2D Shooting Game 
+ Create Tutorial to create this

Shooting game in two-dimension may be the simplest group of the games. The graphic shall be drawn in 3-dimension space but our world is limited in 2-dimension. This is because I'm not good at drawing DOT characters. 

Fundamentally the programming style is as same as that of 2-dimension. I will comment where is the different things for each GDScripts.
